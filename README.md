Go is an abstract strategy board game for two players. The players alternately place stones of their color on
the board, with the basic objective of forming territories around empty regions of the board. Whoever reaches
the highest score wins, which basically corresponds to the one who controls the larger territory. The game
was invented in China more than 25000 years ago and is believed to be the oldest board game still played
in modern times.

Board can be 9x9, 13x13 or 19x19
To pass the turn just press 'P' if both players press 'P' the game ends.
To put a stone just write the letter of the collumn and then the number of the line like B7.

NOTE: the game is in Portuguese (due to project specifications) but it's easy to understand what it means.

Enjoy :)
